# H-ckerrank
I started H@ckerrank today. 
I joined a Pyth0n meetup today that is also doing some stuff on H@ckerrank. 
It's fun so I'm supplementing my Katas with these challenges.
I hope to do the same sort of thing, where I note topics or things I need to work on, or learn.

11/1/17 - Update
- Focusing on this instead of CodeWars. 
- Lots more interview questions are from this, so...I plan on doing one a day,
  or about 5 to 6 a week.
